```sql
photos (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    filename TEXT,
    filepath TEXT UNIQUE,
    file_size INTEGER,
    date_added TIMESTAMP,
    date_taken TIMESTAMP,
    camera_make TEXT,
    camera_model TEXT,
    lens_model TEXT,
    focal_length REAL,
    aperture REAL,
    shutter_speed TEXT,
    iso INTEGER,
    flash TEXT,
    orientation INTEGER,
    width INTEGER,
    height INTEGER,
    gps_latitude REAL,
    gps_longitude REAL,
    gps_altitude REAL,
    gps_location_name TEXT,
    metadata_json TEXT
)
```
